# My Road To C++

Originally with a purpose to write a graphicial manager for [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/), I decided to learn some basic C++.

C++ is known for its complexity and internal chaos, but I still believe it is a "de facto" industry standard in high-level programming. Rust is great, but it lacks of a strong base for user-facing application development. In C++, there are Qt, GTKmm, wxWidgets, Win32/MFC/WinUI and more. And Rust introduces some concepts to memory management which I think should be learned later. So, let's go with C++ first. (And Rust later, maybe!)

Here I opened a repository to track my learning progress. Firstly I will use the great book *A Tour of C++ (Second Edition)* (Chinese Translation) by C++'s creator Bjarne Stroustrup. Then I will progress to GUI development with some great libraries. Eventually I will learn some C++. Hopefully.

Will be in Chinese only. This readme is only for description.

# 我的 C++ 学习路径

本来是想给 [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/) 写个图形界面管理器的，然后就突然想学 C++ 了。

C++ 很混沌邪恶没错，但我觉得它确实是高级程序设计界的“行业标准”。Rust 很好，但是它没什么面向用户的应用开发的底子；而在 C++ 里，则有 Qt、GTKmm、WxWidgets、Win32/MFC/WinUI 等框架。Rust 还引入了一套全新的内存管理理念，我觉得应该以后再去学。所以我打算先学 C++（前面的 Rust 以后再来探索吧.jpg）。

于是我开了个仓库来记录我的学习历程。我用的教材是 C++ 之父 Bjarne Stroustrup 的著作《C++ 语言导学》（第二版中文版，机械工业出版社）。之后我会借助一些库学习 GUI 开发。但愿我能学会一点吧！
